"""JS bridge -- pywebview `js_api` object.

    statement (bridge.py's grep gate allows exactly one `try:`, inside
    `bridge_op`). `__exit__` always releases if this guard actually
    acquired the lock, regardless of whether the `with` body raised.

    This class used to be named `_NonBlockingGuard`, but that only
    describes one of its two modes --
    its own docstring below has always admitted `timeout>0` is a real
    BLOCKING acquire, so the old name was actively misleading at every
    `timeout>0` call site (`_stop_hotkey_impl`). Renamed to describe what
    it actually does in both modes: acquire a lock, non-blocking or
    blocking depending on `timeout`.

    `timeout=0` (default) is a non-blocking acquire -- a second concurrent
    caller fails immediately (used by `start_hotkey`, where a second click
    should report busy right away). `timeout>0` is a short blocking acquire
    (used by `_stop_hotkey_impl`, so a stop racing a still-starting hotkey
    waits for start to finish instead of silently no-op'ing against a
    `_hotkey_toggle` that hasn't been set yet). `timeout=None` is an
    UNBOUNDED blocking acquire (used by `_resolve_guard_unbounded_under_lock`, whose
    two callers -- the auto-revert timer and app.py's window-close handler
    -- have no interactive caller to report "busy" to and must simply wait
    out any in-progress operation, however long it takes).

    Readability note: passing a raw `timeout=` value at the call site does
    not by itself signal which of these three qualitatively different waits
    is intended -- that distinction previously lived only in this docstring,
    not in the call-site shape. Prefer the named constructors below
    (`non_blocking`, `bounded`, `unbounded`) at every call site instead of
    constructing directly with `timeout=`; the raw parameter remains for
    internal use by those constructors and for backward compatibility.

class Api:
    """pywebview `js_api` object. Public methods are `@bridge_op`-wrapped;
    method BODIES contain zero try/except -- the decorator owns all
    exception-to-envelope conversion and lock cleanup. `self._op_lock` is a
    plain `threading.Lock` (not RLock -- reentrancy would silently allow
    nested monitor ops).

    Most public methods are thin delegations into display.py/hotkey.py/
    updater.py/config.py/monitors.py/recovery.py, but this class is not
    purely a delegation surface: it also owns the crash-recovery/
    auto-revert state machine for monitor-disable operations directly, in
    a set of private helper methods (`_resolve_guard_for_enabled_ids`,
    `_build_and_save_pending_record`, `_arm_auto_revert_guard`,
    `_arm_guard_timer`, `_maybe_retry_auto_revert`, `_resolve_pending_now`,
    `_resolve_pending_now_bounded_under_lock`, `recover_on_boot`, and others below).
    That logic lives here rather than in monitors.py/recovery.py because it
    is inherently tied to this instance's own lock/timer/guard state
    (`self._op_lock`, `self._pending_guard`, `self._pending_guard_timer`),
    not because it is a thin pass-through.

    Concurrency model
    ------------------
    Five primitives coordinate concurrent access to this instance's state.
    Read this section once before touching any lock-related code here --
    the individual docstrings below on `bridge_op` and on the
    `_resolve_pending_now`/`_resolve_pending_now_bounded_under_lock`/
    `_resolve_guard_unbounded_under_lock` trio go into per-case detail, but
    this is the one place the whole picture is assembled:

    - `self._op_lock`: the main lock. `bridge_op(lock=True)` acquires it
      non-blocking around a monitor-mutating method's body, so a second
      concurrent call reports kind="busy" instead of queueing or racing.
    - `self._hotkey_lock`: guards hotkey start/stop against a second
      concurrent toggle. Independent of `self._op_lock`.
    - `self._boot_recovery_lock`: serializes concurrent `recover_on_boot`
      calls so only one thread runs the crash-recovery resolution ladder
      at a time.
    - `self._pending_guard` / `self._pending_guard_timer`: the single
      global auto-revert guard slot and its timer, tracking at most one
      in-flight pending-disable record.
    - `self._boot_armed`, together with `bridge_op`'s
      `boot_armed_bypass=`/`releases_boot_arm=` kwargs: lets one specific
      method skip the normal busy-check and later release `self._op_lock`
      on behalf of an unresolved boot-time recovery session.

    Naming convention -- read this before adding any new
    `self._op_lock`-touching helper: a method whose name ends in
    `_under_lock` ACQUIRES `self._op_lock` itself; call it from a context
    that does NOT already hold the lock. A method with no such suffix
    (e.g. `_resolve_pending_now`) instead requires the CALLER to already
    hold `self._op_lock` -- calling it without the lock held trips an
    assertion, and wrapping a call to an `_under_lock`-suffixed method in
    your own extra `with self._op_lock:` will self-deadlock, since
    `self._op_lock` is a plain, non-reentrant `threading.Lock` (see above).

    The two families this file has: for pending-state resolution, the
    caller-must-already-hold-the-lock method is `_resolve_pending_now`,
    and its acquires-the-lock-itself counterpart is
    `_resolve_pending_now_bounded_under_lock` (bounded acquire, since it is
    reached synchronously from a user-re-invocable JS call). For
    guard-state resolution the acquires-the-lock-itself method is
    `_resolve_guard_unbounded_under_lock` (unbounded acquire, since its
    callers -- a background timer and the window-close handler -- have no
    interactive caller waiting on them); its own caller-must-already-hold-
    the-lock helpers are `_arm_guard_timer` and `_maybe_retry_auto_revert`,
    reused from both `_resolve_guard_unbounded_under_lock`'s own acquire
    and the `bridge_op(lock=True)` callers that arm/retry a guard directly
    (`set_monitors_enabled`, `revert_now`).

    Every caller-must-already-hold-the-lock method named above
    (`_resolve_pending_now`, `_arm_guard_timer`, `_maybe_retry_auto_revert`)
    asserts `self._op_lock.locked()` at its own top, turning a future call
    from an unlocked context into a loud `AssertionError` at the exact call
    site instead of a silent race over the state it touches.

        place that reverts to native on stop -- never duplicated logic.

        Guarded by the same `self._hotkey_lock` `start_hotkey` uses, so a
        stop racing a still-starting hotkey can no longer silently no-op
        (reading `self._hotkey_toggle` as still None while start finishes
        moments later and leaves the hotkey live). Unlike `start_hotkey`'s
        non-blocking guard, this is a short blocking acquire
        (`_HOTKEY_STOP_LOCK_TIMEOUT_S`) so an ordinary stop simply waits out
        an in-progress start instead of failing outright -- this also
        preserves correctness for `webview/app.py`'s synchronous
        window-close handler, which calls this directly (not through
        `bridge_op`) and needs the revert to actually happen, not to bail
        immediately.

        A failed native-resolution revert is now raised (unlike the
        discarded result this used to be) so it isn't silently reported as
        a successful stop -- the bridge_op-wrapped `stop_hotkey` call site
        lets the decorator's existing catch-and-envelope machinery surface
        it; `_on_closing` propagates it same as any other exception during
        window teardown.

        `toggle.stop()` now runs BEFORE the `is_stretched` read and the
        revert call, not after. With the old read-then-revert-then-stop
        order, the hotkey stayed registered for the entire duration of the
        revert call: a physical press landing in that window dispatched
        WM_HOTKEY on the still-live listener thread, which ran
        `HotkeyToggle._toggle()`'s own `set_resolution` call concurrently
        with this method's unlocked revert call -- two unsynchronized
        `ChangeDisplaySettingsW` calls on two different threads, with no
        ordering guarantee over which one won. `toggle.stop()` unregisters
        the hotkey and joins the listener thread, which only exits once it
        has fully finished whatever message it was already processing
        (including an in-flight `_toggle()` call queued right before
        WM_QUIT takes effect) -- so by the time `stop()` returns, no press
        can still be in flight and no new one can be dispatched, and the
        `is_stretched` read that follows is both stable and safe to act on
        without racing a concurrent toggle.

        call actually attempted a revert (`triggered`) but did not fully
        resolve the guard -- i.e. the elevated UAC prompt this attempt
        depended on was never answered (missed/ignored on a black screen)
        or the revert genuinely failed. See the residual-limitation comment
        above `_AUTO_REVERT_MAX_ATTEMPTS` for why this cannot fully solve
        the underlying "elevation needs an interactive prompt" problem --
        this only bounds how many extra chances that prompt gets.

        Also called directly by `revert_now` for the same reason after its
        own manual, immediate re-enable attempt reports at least one
        target that did not genuinely succeed -- a user-triggered revert
        attempt gets the exact same bounded retry budget as a timer-
        triggered one instead of losing the guard's protection outright.

        No-op (leaves the guard exactly as-is, pending/unresolved) when:
        - the guard already fully resolved (nothing left to retry);
        - `self._pending_guard` no longer points at this exact guard object

          never resurrects a stale/replaced guard's timer;
        - the attempt budget (`_AUTO_REVERT_MAX_ATTEMPTS`) is exhausted.

        In every no-op case above, the guard is left pending/unresolved and
        the on-disk crash-recovery record survives untouched -- the existing
        manual force-unlock path (`force_unlock_pending`) remains the way
        out, same as before this retry behavior existed.

        Like `_arm_guard_timer` (which this method calls into on the retry

        boot call -- can both reach `_resolve_pending_now` at once. Both
        read the same on-disk `pending_restore.json` record and the same
        helper result file, and `monitors.read_op_result` DELETES that file
        on read -- a second concurrent reader arriving right after the
        first one's delete would silently see nothing, corrupting the
        crash-recovery resolution for that boot/check cycle.

        Uses a SHORT bounded blocking acquire (`_RESOLVE_PENDING_LOCK_TIMEOUT_S`),
        not the unbounded `timeout=None` pattern `_resolve_guard_unbounded_under_lock`
        uses -- that method's callers (a background timer, a window-close
        handler) have no interactive caller waiting on it, but this one is
        reached synchronously from a user-re-invocable JS call. If the lock
        is instead held long-term by an outstanding boot-armed recovery
        session (only released once the user acts on the recovery UI that
        THIS very call is responsible for rendering), waiting unboundedly
        here would freeze the app. On timeout, this returns `None` rather
        than reading/mutating anything without the lock -- a safe no-op,
        not a corrupted read; the next boot/retry picks up the real state
        once the lock frees.

        `None` (timed out, nothing was read) is
        a DIFFERENT return value from `[]` (the lock was acquired and the
        resolution genuinely produced no outcomes, e.g. no pending record on
        disk at all) -- `recover_on_boot` needs to tell these two apart so it
        never caches a timeout as if it were a completed resolution.

        the JS side already calls before any render
        (`boot() = S = await call('get_initial_state')`), rather than a
        separate webview/app.py startup function.

        Only an IN_FLIGHT outcome re-arms `self._op_lock`; every
        other outcome is notice-only. A Python `Lock` may be released by a
        thread other than the one that acquired it, so re-arming here is a
        direct `acquire()`, not going through `bridge_op(lock=True)`.

        Reads pending state through `_resolve_pending_now_bounded_under_lock`
        (not the raw `_resolve_pending_now`) so two concurrent calls to this
        method -- reached from the unlocked `get_initial_state`, directly
        re-invocable via the boot-error Retry button -- are serialized
        instead of racing each other over the same on-disk record and
        result file.

        That serialization only protected ACCESS to
        the on-disk record/result file -- it did not make a second call
        (running strictly AFTER a first, already-completed call) compute the
        SAME resolution. `monitors.read_op_result` destructively deletes the
        helper result file on its first read, so a second call that re-ran
        this whole ladder against a record the first call intentionally left
        on disk (a mixed outcome set that still needs manual force-unlock)
        would read an empty result set and could land on a worse/different
        outcome for a target the first call already resolved confidently --
        the boot-error Retry button has no debounce, so a double-click is
        enough to trigger this. Fixed by making this method idempotent
        within the process lifetime: the first completed resolution is
        cached on `self._boot_recovery_result` and every later call simply
        returns that cache instead of re-deriving one from by-then-consumed
        signals. `self._boot_recovery_lock` (see `__init__`) serializes the
        cache check, the resolution, and the eventual `config.clear_pending()`
        call against each other, so no call can read/set the cache or clear
        the on-disk record while another call is still mid-resolution. A
        bounded-lock timeout (`_resolve_pending_now_bounded_under_lock`
        returning `None`) is deliberately never cached -- it is not a
        completed resolution, so a later call must still retry once
        `self._op_lock` frees.

        """Resolve a pending-disable guard's auto-revert check while
        ACQUIRING `self._op_lock` itself -- a real BLOCKING acquire, unlike
        bridge_op's normal non-blocking pattern, since neither caller of
        this method has a user waiting on immediate feedback; both simply
        need to wait out any in-progress operation first, then proceed.

        Named with an `_unbounded_` marker (as opposed to
        `_resolve_pending_now_bounded_under_lock`'s `_bounded_` marker) so
        the acquire semantics are visible from the method name itself, not
        only from its docstring.

        `source_timer`, when given, is the exact `threading.Timer` instance
        whose expiry called into this method (`_arm_guard_timer` passes
        itself this way). It exists to close a real race: `Timer.cancel()`
        is a no-op once the real timer thread has already passed
        `Timer.run()`'s own one-time "am I cancelled" check and started
        calling its function -- including while that call is merely
        blocked here waiting for `self._op_lock`. If some other caller
        (typically `revert_now`'s own partial-failure retry branch) wins
        the lock first and supersedes this timer -- arming a fresh one via
        `_arm_guard_timer`, or tearing it down entirely once the guard
        fully resolves -- `self._pending_guard_timer` no longer `is` this
        `source_timer` by the time this call finally gets the lock. Once
        that happens, re-running `guard.check()` here would fire a second,
        entirely unrequested real revert attempt (a second UAC prompt) and
        could arm a redundant third timer via `_maybe_retry_auto_revert` for
        what is really still the same logical retry cycle. `source_timer`
        left as `None` (the default, used by `webview/app.py`'s
        window-close handler and `confirm_update`'s background resolver --
        neither is tied to a specific timer instance) skips this check
        entirely, matching this method's behavior before `source_timer`
        existed.

        Shared by two callers that must never run this concurrently with a
        `bridge_op(lock=True)`-guarded method's body (keep_disabled/
        revert_now/force_unlock_pending, which hold this same lock):
        - the real `threading.Timer` armed in `set_monitors_enabled` on a
          confirmed disable, so the 10s auto-revert can never race a
          concurrent keep_disabled/revert_now right at the boundary and
          leave the crash-recovery record and the actual device state
          disagreeing;
        - webview/app.py's window-close handler, so a disable still in its
          grace period gets resolved synchronously before the process
          exits, instead of dying with this method's daemon-thread caller.

        Routed through `config.call_logged` (not a local try/except --
        bridge.py's own invariant of exactly one `try:` statement, the one
        inside `bridge_op`, must stay intact) so a failure in this
        background/teardown path still leaves a trace in quickres.log
        instead of vanishing silently under QuickRes.spec's console=False
        build.

        `call_logged` returns `None` instead of
        re-raising if `revert_fn` raised, so `triggered` below is falsy
        whenever the revert attempt itself raised -- the pending record
        deliberately survives in that case so a future `recover_on_boot`
        can still surface the unresolved state instead of it being silently
        lost.

        A raised exception must be eligible
        for the same bounded retry budget (`_maybe_retry_auto_revert`) as a
        normal `ok=False` failure -- `triggered` being falsy here is
        ambiguous between "not expired / already resolved yet, nothing to
        retry" and "expired, attempted, and the attempt raised". Recomputing
        `guard.is_expired(now)` disambiguates: it is only True once `check()`
        has actually passed its own expiry gate, whether the attempt that
        followed raised, returned a partial failure, or fully resolved the
        guard. Retrying is therefore driven by "expired and still
        unresolved" rather than solely by `triggered`, so an exception on
        the very first attempt no longer silently defeats attempts 2 and 3.

        `triggered` (guard.check()'s return value)
        only means "a revert attempt was made this call" -- NOT "it
        succeeded" (see monitors.PendingDisableGuard.check's own docstring;
        the real `revert_fn` deliberately never raises for an expected
        per-target failure, it reports `ok=False` results instead). So a
        genuine per-target outcome must be read from `guard.last_results`
        and only the ids that actually succeeded (`ok=True`) get trimmed --
        a target that failed keeps its crash-recovery entry rather than
        being trimmed just because SOME target in the same guard succeeded
        or because `revert_fn` happened not to raise.

        The lock acquire/release used to be two
        bare statements around this body with no `try/finally` -- this
        method sits OUTSIDE `bridge_op`'s own try/finally machinery (it is
        not itself `bridge_op`-wrapped), so any exception raised by
        `_clear_or_trim_pending_record` after a successful `guard.check()`
        permanently leaked `self._op_lock`, locking every monitor operation
        out until the app restarted. `_LockAcquireGuard` (already used
        elsewhere in this file for `self._hotkey_lock`) is reused here via
        its `unbounded()` constructor for the same unbounded-blocking
        semantics the old code had, but its `__exit__` unconditionally
        releases regardless of
        whether the `with` body raised -- without needing a second literal
        `try:` statement, which would break this file's own single-`try:`
        grep gate.
