    same way `open(path, "w")` would, except that a reparse point (NTFS
    symlink/junction) sitting at `path` is opened as itself instead of being
    transparently followed through to whatever it points at.

    `binary`, when True, hands back a bytes-mode file object (equivalent to
    `open(path, "wb")`) instead of the default text/UTF-8 mode -- both modes
    share the exact same reparse-refusing CreateFileW call below, this only
    changes how the already-opened handle is wrapped. Added so a caller
    writing binary content (e.g. quickres/updater.py staging a downloaded
    executable) can reuse this same guard instead of plain open(), without
    disturbing the default text-mode behavior every existing caller of this
    function already relies on.

    `append`, when True, hands back a file object equivalent to
    `open(path, "a", encoding="utf-8")` instead: the file is opened with
    OPEN_ALWAYS (create it if missing, but never truncate an existing one)
    rather than CREATE_ALWAYS, and the handle's position is seeked to the
    current end-of-file before being wrapped, so writes land after existing
    content instead of overwriting it. Added for quickres/config.py's own
    log_msg(), which must accumulate log lines across repeated calls rather
    than truncating quickres.log on every single write -- CREATE_ALWAYS's
    always-truncate semantics (what every other caller of this function
    wants) would otherwise destroy prior log history each time. Both modes
    share the exact same reparse-refusing CreateFileW/
    GetFileInformationByHandle sequence below; this only changes the
    creation disposition passed to CreateFileW and how the already-opened
    handle is wrapped.

    Plain open() (and os.replace()) ultimately call CreateFileW without
    FILE_FLAG_OPEN_REPARSE_POINT. On Windows that makes CreateFileW follow a
    file symlink to its target, and with CREATE_ALWAYS semantics the target
    is truncated the instant the call succeeds -- before any Python-level
    code has a chance to notice and refuse. A "check reparse status, then
    open" sequence, no matter how tight the two calls sit next to each
    other, always leaves some window between the check and the open in
    which a symlink can be planted, and the truncation this function exists
    to prevent has already happened by the time such a check could run.
    Passing FILE_FLAG_OPEN_REPARSE_POINT removes that window entirely: the
    single CreateFileW call itself opens the reparse point object, never a
    followed target, so nothing downstream of it is ever truncated --
    whether the object turns out to be a reparse point is then just a
    property of the handle already in hand, not a separate, racy filesystem
    check performed against the path a second time.

    Returns a writable Python file object (equivalent to what
    `open(path, "w", encoding="utf-8")` would hand back) when `path` names a
    genuine new or existing regular file -- created/truncated exactly as
    open() would, just without ever risking a followed-target truncation
    along the way. Returns None, with the handle already closed and nothing
    written or truncated, when `path` is itself a reparse point.

    Without this, CreateMutexW(None, ...) creates the mutex with default
    security, which on a typical desktop grants any other same-user,
    unprivileged process enough access to pre-create/open the exact same
    named mutex before QuickRes ever runs -- letting it make
    enforce_single_instance() always believe the real app is already
    running, so the real app exits without ever creating its window (a
    same-user denial-of-service).

    Builds the descriptor from the SDDL string _MUTEX_SDDL ("D:(A;;GA;;;OW)"
    -- allow Generic-All to Owner only) via
    ConvertStringSecurityDescriptorToSecurityDescriptorW rather than
    hand-assembling SID/ACL/ACE structures with ctypes: it is the
    Microsoft-documented shortcut for exactly this "owner-only" case and
    far less error-prone to get right.

    This deliberately has no explicit Deny-Everyone ACE. An earlier
    revision used "D:(D;;GA;;;WD)(A;;GA;;;OW)" (deny Generic-All to World,
    *then* allow Generic-All to Owner), but Windows AccessCheck walks a
    DACL's ACEs in listed order and denies the whole request at the first
    matching Deny ACE -- it never skips ahead to a later, more specific
    Allow ACE for the same principal. Every logged-on user's token
    (including the object's own owner) carries the Everyone/World SID, so
    that Deny(WD) ACE also matched the owner and denied it, before the
    Allow(OW) ACE was ever reached: the owner could create the mutex on
    first launch (object creation is not access-checked against its own
    new DACL) but could never reopen it on a second launch, which instead
    failed with ERROR_ACCESS_DENIED. A DACL containing only an explicit
    Allow-Owner ACE already implicitly denies every other, unlisted
    principal under normal Windows semantics, so dropping the redundant
    (and self-defeating) Deny-Everyone ACE loses no hardening.

    Returns None on any failure. CreateMutexW's lpMutexAttributes parameter
    already accepts NULL to mean "use default security" -- the original,
    unhardened behavior -- so a failure here is treated as "hardening
    unavailable this run", not a reason to abort single-instance
    enforcement altogether.
