    `_is_pid_alive`'s raw OpenProcess+GetExitCodeProcess probe
    on `helper_pid` only proves some process currently holds that PID
    number -- not that it is the SAME process originally launched as the
    helper. Windows recycles PIDs quickly, so between the helper's PID being
    captured and this check running later (e.g. across `recheck_pending`/
    `recover_on_boot` after a crash), an unrelated process can have been
    assigned that exact PID. When the caller supplies `helper_pid_start_time`
    (the creation time captured alongside `helper_pid` when it was first
    recorded, via `get_process_start_time`), a "PID exists" result is only
    trusted as ALIVE once its CURRENT creation time is re-queried and found
    to match -- any mismatch, or a creation time that can no longer be
    queried at all, forces UNKNOWN rather than a false ALIVE, mirroring the
    owner_pid guard above. When no `helper_pid_start_time` is supplied (the
    caller has nothing recorded to compare against -- e.g. an older pending
    record predating this field), this guard is skipped and behavior is
    unchanged from before.

    `helper_pid`/`owner_pid` both come straight off an on-disk record with
    no schema enforcement on read, so either can in principle be some
    non-int value (disk corruption that still parses as valid JSON, a
    partial write from an older build, manual editing). `owner_pid` is only
    ever compared with `!=`, which is already type-safe -- a mismatched
    type simply compares unequal and falls into the same UNKNOWN branch a
    mismatched pid number would, so its explicit type check below documents
    that safety rather than changing behavior. `helper_pid` is different: it
    gets passed straight into `_is_pid_alive`'s ctypes `OpenProcess` call,
    which is declared with a `DWORD` argtype and raises
    `ctypes.ArgumentError` for a non-int argument -- an exception this
    function's own `except OSError` does not catch. A non-int `helper_pid`
    is therefore treated the same way an unopenable/unqueryable process
    already is elsewhere in this function: as liveness that cannot be

    before elevation starts. When omitted the path is generated internally.
    Either way, the final path is validated via `recovery.is_safe_result_path`
    before being interpolated into the elevated helper's command line
    (`_build_helper_params`) -- instance ids are validated against their own
    injection allowlist just above, but a caller-supplied result_path was
    previously interpolated unescaped with no validation at all, mirroring
    the read-side check `read_op_result` already performs and the elevated
    helper's own write-side check in main.py.

    `on_helper_launched`, when supplied, is invoked synchronously with the
    elevated helper's real PID right after launch (via
    `kernel32.GetProcessId` on the raw `ShellExecuteExW` process handle),
    BEFORE waiting for it to finish -- this is what lets a caller persist
    the real helper_pid into its own crash-recovery record as early as
    possible, instead of it staying permanently None (which otherwise
    forces `process_liveness()` to UNKNOWN forever). Omitted by default so

        regardless of whether that attempt genuinely succeeded. Callers
        MUST NOT treat a True return as proof of success; read
        `last_results`/`resolved` for the real outcome.

        `resolved` is set only AFTER `revert_fn`
        returns, not before. `revert_fn` is a real Win32/ctypes call chain
        in production and can raise; if it does, this method lets the
        exception propagate (the caller -- bridge.py's
        `_resolve_guard_unbounded_under_lock`, via `config.call_logged` -- is what turns
        it into a logged, non-fatal failure) and deliberately leaves the
        guard unresolved, so a subsequent `check()` call retries the revert
        instead of silently treating a failed revert as done.

        "Didn't raise" is not the same as
        "genuinely succeeded". The real production `revert_fn` (bridge.py's
        lambda wrapping `monitors.set_monitors_enabled`) is deliberately
        built to NEVER raise for expected failure modes -- it always
        returns a `list[(instance_id, ok, message, kind)]` instead, exactly like
        `set_monitors_enabled`'s own return shape, with `ok=False` entries
        for a genuine per-target failure. A prior version of this method
        marked itself `resolved=True` the moment `revert_fn` returned at
        all, so a revert that failed for every single target (an entirely
        normal, non-exceptional outcome for that function) was still
        reported as "resolved" -- letting a caller clear the on-disk
        crash-recovery record for a monitor that, in truth, is still
        disabled.

        `revert_fn`'s return value is captured on `last_results` every time
        it is actually called (success or partial failure alike), and
        `resolved` only flips to True once EVERY target id in
        `self._target_ids` has a genuinely successful (`ok=True`) result.
        A partial success (some targets revert, others don't) leaves the
        guard unresolved, so a later poll retries the whole batch again
        (re-reverting an already-enabled target is a harmless no-op). This
        lets callers (bridge.py's `_resolve_guard_unbounded_under_lock`) trim only the
        genuinely-succeeded targets out of the crash-recovery record instead
        of assuming the whole batch resolved just because nothing raised.

        permanently True for the rest of its life, no matter how far in
        the future the real next scheduled retry actually was. Any caller
        that resolves the guard between two scheduled attempts (a

        guard) would immediately re-fire a real revert attempt ahead of
        schedule instead of waiting for the timer that is actually still
