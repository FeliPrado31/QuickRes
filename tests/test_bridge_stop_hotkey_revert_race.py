"""Round 21 finding 4 (HIGH): `_stop_hotkey_impl` used to read
`toggle.is_stretched` and call `display.set_resolution` for the
native-resolution revert BEFORE calling `toggle.stop()` -- so the hotkey
stayed registered for the whole duration of that revert call. A physical
hotkey press landing in that window dispatches WM_HOTKEY on the listener
thread, which runs `HotkeyToggle._toggle()` (its own `set_resolution` call)
CONCURRENTLY with `_stop_hotkey_impl`'s unlocked revert call -- two
unsynchronized `ChangeDisplaySettingsW` calls racing on two different
threads, with no ordering guarantee over which one wins.

Fix: `_stop_hotkey_impl` now calls `toggle.stop()` (which unregisters the
hotkey and joins the listener thread -- so it does not return until any
message the worker thread was already processing, including an in-flight
`_toggle()` call, has fully finished) BEFORE reading `is_stretched` or
calling the revert's `display.set_resolution`. This closes the race: by
the time the revert call runs, no hotkey press can still be in flight and
no new one can be dispatched (the hotkey is unregistered).
