"""Round 9 finding (HIGH): `_resolve_guard_unbounded_under_lock` acquires
`self._op_lock` by hand (it sits outside `bridge_op`'s own try/finally
machinery -- it is not itself `bridge_op`-wrapped) and used to release it
with a bare statement after the guard-check/trim body, not a try/finally.
Any exception raised by `_clear_or_trim_pending_record` after a successful
`guard.check()` permanently leaked the lock -- every `lock=True` bridge_op
method (`set_monitors_enabled`, `keep_disabled`, `revert_now`,
`force_unlock_pending`, `recheck_pending`) would report "busy" forever,
until the app restarted.
