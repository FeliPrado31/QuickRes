"""Round 6 corrective fix for quickres/updater.py (Stream 3):

MEDIUM finding -- TOCTOU window between validation and replace-and-relaunch.
The PE-header + optional SHA-256 checks in `apply_update` run exactly once,
immediately after download, but the actual replace-and-relaunch used to
happen up to 5 seconds later inside the generated `update.bat` (a fixed
`timeout /t 5` existed to let the currently-running exe release its file
handle before `ren` could rename it away). In the typical portable
no-install install, that directory is an ordinary user-writable folder, so
another local process with write access to it had a multi-second window to
swap the already-validated QuickRes_new.exe for a malicious file before the
batch script ever moved it into place.

Two complementary mitigations are verified here:
1. The fixed 5-second sleep before the rename is replaced with a short
   polling loop that retries the rename itself as soon as the file lock
   releases (faster in the common case; same worst-case ceiling).
2. A lightweight `powershell -Command` one-liner re-verifies the staged
   QuickRes_new.exe's PE header (and its SHA-256 again, if an expected hash
   was supplied) immediately before the `move /y` that stages it, so a file
   swapped into place during the wait is caught right before it would ever
   run.
